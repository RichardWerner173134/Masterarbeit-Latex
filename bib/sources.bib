@phdthesis{Dey.,
 abstract = {In recent years, cloud or utility computing has revolutionized the way software, hardware and network infrastructure is provisioned and deployed into production. A key component of these vast, diverse and heterogeneous systems is the persistence layer provided by a variety of data store and database services, broadly categorised into what is referred to as NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases or data stores. These come in many flavours from simple key-value stores and column stores to database services with support for SQL-like interfaces.  These systems are primarily designed to operate at internet-scale with high scalability and fault-tolerance in mind. As a result, they typically sacrifice consistency guarantees and often support only single-item consistent operations or no transactions at all. While these consistency limitations are fine for a wide class of applications, there are a few or sometimes only parts of larger applications that need ACID transactional guarantees in order to function correctly.  To address this, we define a data store client API, we call REST+T (REST with Transactions), an extension of HTTP that supports transactions on one store. Then, we use this to define a client-coordinated transaction commitment protocol and library, called Cherry Garcia, to enable easy applications development across diverse, heterogeneous data stores that each support single-item transactions. We extend the well known YCSB benchmark, to present YCSB+T, to enable us to group multiple data store operations into ACID transactions and evaluate properties such as throughput. YCSB+T also provides the ability to detect and quantify data store anomalies that result from the execution of the workload. Finally, we describe our prototype implementations of REST+T in a system called Tora, and our client-coordinated transaction library, also called Cherry Garcia, that supports transactions across Windows Azure Storage (WAS), Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and Tora. We evaluate these using both YCSB+T and micro-benchmarks.},
